# URL-Shortener
The URL-Shortener GitHub project is a tool designed to convert long URLs into shorter, more concise ones. It provides a web application and backend server that generate unique, memorable shortened URLs. When a user accesses a shortened URL, the server redirects them to the original long URL.
